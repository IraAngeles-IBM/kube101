<p>In this lab, you&apos;ll learn how to update the number of instances
a deployment has and how to safely roll out an update of your application
on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>For this lab, you need a running deployment of the <code>guestbook</code> application
from the previous lab. If you need to create it, run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl create deployment guestbook --image=ibmcom/guestbook:v1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="1-scale-apps-with-replicas">1. Scale apps with replicas</h2>
<p>A <em>replica</em> is a copy of a pod that contains a running service. By having
multiple replicas of a pod, you can ensure your deployment has the available
resources to handle increasing load on your application.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>kubectl</code> provides a <code>scale</code> subcommand to change the size of an
existing deployment. Let&apos;s increase our capacity from a single running instance of
<code>guestbook</code> up to 10 instances:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>Kubernetes will now try to make reality match the desired state of
10 replicas by starting 9 new pods with the same configuration as
the first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To see your changes being rolled out, you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>The rollout might occur so quickly that the following messages might
<em>not</em> display:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook
Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 3 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 5 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 6 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 7 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 8 of 10 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 of 10 updated replicas are available...
deployment &quot;guestbook&quot; successfully rolled out
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Once the rollout has finished, ensure your pods are running by using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl get pods
</code></pre>
<p>You should see output listing 10 replicas of your deployment:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

guestbook-562211614-zsp0j   1/1       Running   0          2m
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Another way to improve availability is to
<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha_clusters#ha_clusters" target="_blank">add clusters and regions</a>
to your deployment, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="../images/cs_cluster_ha_roadmap_multizone_public.png" alt="HA with more clusters and regions"></p>
<h2 id="2-update-and-roll-back-apps">2. Update and roll back apps</h2>
<p>Kubernetes allows you to do rolling upgrade of your application to a new
container image. This allows you to easily update the running image and also allows you to
easily undo a rollout if a problem is discovered during or after deployment.</p>
<p>In the previous lab, we used an image with a <code>v1</code> tag. For our upgrade
we&apos;ll use the image with the <code>v2</code> tag.</p>
<p>To update and roll back:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using <code>kubectl</code>, you can now update your deployment to use the
<code>v2</code> image. <code>kubectl</code> allows you to change details about existing
resources with the <code>set</code> subcommand. We can use it to change the
image being used.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell"> kubectl set image deployment/guestbook guestbook=ibmcom/guestbook:v2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that a pod could have multiple containers, each with its own name.
Each image can be changed individually or all at once by referring to the name.
In the case of our <code>guestbook</code> Deployment, the container name is also <code>guestbook</code>.
Multiple containers can be updated at the same time.
(<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-image-em-" target="_blank">More information</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>To check the status of the rollout, run:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>The rollout might occur so quickly that the following messages
might <em>not</em> display:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook

deployment &quot;guestbook&quot; successfully rolled out
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Test the application as before, by accessing <code>&lt;public-IP&gt;:&lt;nodeport&gt;</code>
in the browser to confirm your new code is active.</p>
<p>Remember, to get the &quot;nodeport&quot; and &quot;public-ip&quot; use the following commands. Replace <code>$CLUSTER_NAME</code> with the name of your cluster if the environment variable is not set.:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl describe service guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">ibmcloud ks workers --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
</code></pre>
<p>To verify that you&apos;re running &quot;v2&quot; of guestbook, look at the title of the page,
it should now be <code>Guestbook - v2</code>. If you are using a browser, make sure you force refresh (invalidating your cache).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to undo your latest rollout, use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl rollout undo deployment guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>You can then use this command to see the status:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>When doing a rollout, you see references to <em>old</em> replicas and <em>new</em> replicas.
The <em>old</em> replicas are the original 10 pods deployed when we scaled the application.
The <em>new</em> replicas come from the newly created pods with the different image.
All of these pods are owned by the Deployment.
The deployment manages these two sets of pods with a resource called a ReplicaSet.
We can see the guestbook ReplicaSets with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">$ kubectl get replicasets -l app=guestbook
NAME                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
guestbook-5f5548d4f    10        10        10        21m
guestbook-768cc55c78   0         0         0         3h
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we continue, let&apos;s delete the application so we can learn about
a different way to achieve the same results:</p>
<p> To remove the deployment, use </p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell"> kubectl delete deployment guestbook
</code></pre>
<p> To remove the service, use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell"> kubectl delete service guestbook
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations! You deployed the second version of the app. Lab 2
is now complete. Continue to the <a href="../Lab3/README.md">next lab of this course</a>.</p>
